# Migration scripts live here. Schema is unified in 001_unified_schema.

# Apply all migrations (fresh or after redo):
#   alembic upgrade head
#   # or from python/: make migrate-up

# Roll back to empty state:
#   alembic downgrade base
#   # or: make migrate-down

# Redo (full reset and re-apply): drop all tables, then run upgrade again.
#   alembic downgrade base && alembic upgrade head
#   # or from python/: make migrate-redo

# Create a new revision (when adding schema changes):
#   alembic revision -m "description"
